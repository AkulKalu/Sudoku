### Sudoku App

This is the first thing i ever made, therefore probably not the best on the eye.
Recently i went back to it to change the theme and was suprised how unsatisfied i was with
the development choises. Nevertheless it shows my beginings and my thinking process months ago.
In all of my projects my aim was always to practice and learn, not really to make a polished app, and 
besides the constrictions of a framework , if im using one, i never really followed any design pattern
aside of my own "try everything that crosses your mind" so i could practice and discover on my own why certain
things shouldnt be done a certain way.

As for the app, initialy i just wanted to make a backtracking algorithm visualiser, but later just kept adding things, once
i learned a bit of php, and wanted to use it somwhere.
